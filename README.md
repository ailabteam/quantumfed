# QuantumFed: A Framework for Quantum Federated Learning in Cybersecurity

**QuantumFed** is an open-source research framework designed to explore the intersection of Federated Learning (FL), Quantum Machine Learning (QML), and Cybersecurity. It provides a flexible and extensible platform for training quantum-enhanced models on distributed data for security-related tasks like intrusion detection, malware analysis, and more.

## Core Features

- **Modular Design:** Easily extend the framework with new datasets, models (both quantum and classical), and federated learning strategies.
- **Quantum-Ready:** Built on top of [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/) for seamless integration of QML models with PyTorch.
- **Federation-Powered:** Utilizes [Flower](https://flower.dev/) for a robust and scalable federated learning backend.
- **Reproducibility:** Experiment configurations are managed through YAML files, ensuring that research is easy to replicate.
